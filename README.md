# Blender-Browzwear-FBX-Import
A simple import tool for FBX files created in Browzwear. It only merges the imported objects into one mesh, renames to the fbx file, and set the origin to the geometry.

Either run the script directly from a text window in Blender, or install as an Addon via Preferences.

Creates a tab on the toolbar on the right hand side of the 3d window. There are two options, First is to import a single FBX file. Second is the search a folder and import all the fbx files in that folder.
